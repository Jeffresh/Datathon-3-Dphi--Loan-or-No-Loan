# Datathon 3 Dphi Loan or No Loan?

## Problemn Statement

The director of SZE bank identified that going through the loan applications to filter the people who can be granted loans or need to be rejected is a tedious and time-consuming process. He wants to automate it and increase his bankâ€™s efficiency. After talking around a bit, your name pops up as one of the few data scientists who can make this possible within a limited time. Will you help the director out? 

## Objective

The idea behind this ML project is to build an ML model and web application that the bank can use to classify if a user can be granted a loan or not.
